This purpose of this project is to gather tweets using Twitter's API to perform sentiment analysis. 
I am comparing tweets from 2017-2022 NBA seasons about Russell Westbrook. His MVP season was in 2017 and he has since 
performed worse and acquired the nickname 'Westbrick'. 

## To Run Code
Requirement: need your own academic research bearer token from Twitter. The tweet scraping file is used to gather all of the tweets, however, I have uploaded csv files containing all of the tweets so it isn't necessary to run this file. Use the sentiment analysis notebook to run the sentiment analysis.
